# Take home challenge

## Summary:

The challenge is to implement a basic rewards redemption web app that allows a user to do the following:

- View their current reward points balance.
- Browse available rewards.
- Redeem rewards using their points.
- See a history of their reward redemptions.

## Tech Stack:

You can use whatever technologies you’d like.  I will note that the main technologies at Thanx are React for the front-end, Ruby on Rails for the backend, and MySQL for the database.

## Core Requirements:

### Backend API:

Implement RESTful endpoints for the following:

- Retrieve a user’s current points balance
- Get a list of available rewards
- Allow users to redeem a reward
- Retrieve a user’s redemption history

### Data Persistence:

Use a database of your choice to store the information as you deem fit

### Interface:

Implement a simple interface to interact with the backend API. This could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based interface (Preferred if your focus is on the frontend).

### Documentation:

Provide clear documentation on how to set up and run the application
